Abstract is a non access modifier in java. It is used for classes and methods only.
It is used to achieve abstraction

Abstract Class in java cannot be instantiated i.e we cannot create objects of that class.It can contain regular and abstract methods
A method without its body is known as abstract method

A class containing abstract method must be declared abstract.

We can have subclasses of abstract class and use those subclasses  y inheritnce to access the methods of the abstract class

If an abstract class has an abstract method then all child classes inherited from the abstract class must provide implementation of that method
