/*public class functionloadride {

IF we have functions with same name and same signature(parameters)in different classes it is called function overriding.It is used to
implement dynamic polymorphism.

Functions with same name and different signatures in the SAME class it is called function overloading.It is used to implement
static polymorphism.Because at the time of compilation the compiler knows which function we are going to call.

Private data members of a class can be accessed only within that class.Not from outside the class.

Within a same package we can access all public protected and default members.

in case of inheritance if the child classes have same functions with different names we can access those functions of parent without super

public protected and default members will inherit to derived classes and we can use it freely without super
